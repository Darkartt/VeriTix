# VeriTix Storage Optimization Analysis

**Generated:** 2025-08-27T12:42:28.122Z

## Summary

- **Total Optimizations:** 5
- **High Priority:** 2
- **Medium Priority:** 2
- **Low Priority:** 1
- **Estimated Total Savings:** 121900 gas

## Key Recommendations

### 1. Function-Level Gas Optimizations (HIGH Priority)

Implement immediate gas savings in high-frequency functions

**Actions:**
- Cache immutable variables in mintTicket and resaleTicket functions
- Use unchecked arithmetic for safe operations
- Optimize validation order for early failure
- Minimize storage operations

**Estimated Savings:** 1000-2000 gas per function call
**Implementation Effort:** Low

### 2. Storage Layout Optimization (MEDIUM Priority)

Optimize struct packing for deployment and storage costs

**Actions:**
- Implement optimized Event struct with packed fields
- Validate that reduced field sizes are sufficient
- Update all related functions to handle new types
- Add overflow protection where needed

**Estimated Savings:** 60,000-100,000 gas per deployment
**Implementation Effort:** Medium

### 3. Batch Operation Safety (MEDIUM Priority)

Prevent DoS attacks and failed transactions in batch operations

**Actions:**
- Implement batch size limits
- Add gas estimation before batch execution
- Provide user guidance on optimal batch sizes
- Implement progressive batch processing

**Estimated Savings:** Prevents failed transactions and gas waste
**Implementation Effort:** Low

### 4. Mapping Optimization (LOW Priority)

Combine related mappings for better access patterns

**Actions:**
- Create TicketData struct for combined ticket information
- Update functions to use combined mapping
- Benchmark performance impact
- Consider access pattern implications

**Estimated Savings:** 2000-5000 gas when accessing multiple fields
**Implementation Effort:** High
