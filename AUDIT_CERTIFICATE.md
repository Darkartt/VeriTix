## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### Critical Issues (FIXED) ✅

#### 1. Refund Functionality Vulnerability
**Severity:** CRITICAL → FIXED
**Location:** `VeriTix.sol:refundTicket()` function

**Issue Description:**
The refund transfer mechanism was failing to deliver funds to users despite successful execution.

**Evidence:**
```
Before Fix:
- Function executed successfully (no revert)
- Contract balance decreased correctly
- User balance remained unchanged
- Funds were lost in contract

After Fix:
- Implemented reliable call pattern
- Added explicit success validation
- Funds now transfer correctly to users
```

**Fix Applied:**
```solidity
// Before (Vulnerable)
payable(msg.sender).transfer(refundAmount);

// After (Fixed)
(bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: refundAmount}("");
require(success, "Refund transfer failed");
```

**Impact:** Users can now receive refunds after event cancellation.

#### 2. Frontend Test Suite Issues
**Severity:** CRITICAL → IDENTIFIED
**Location:** Test configuration files

**Issue Description:**
All 31 frontend tests failing due to component import/export issues.

**Evidence:**
```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined
```

**Recommendation:**
Fix component import/export configuration in test environment.

---

### Moderate Issues 🟡

#### 3. Event Mapping Simplification
**Severity:** MODERATE
**Location:** `getTicketEventId()` function

**Issue Description:**
Simplified mapping where `tokenId == eventId` limits functionality for multiple events.

**Recommendation:**
Implement proper `tokenId` to `eventId` mapping for production scalability.

#### 4. Batch Operations Gas Limits
**Severity:** MODERATE
**Location:** `batchBuyTickets()` function

**Issue Description:**
No gas limit checks for large batch operations (up to 20 events/10 tickets each).

**Recommendation:**
Add gas estimation and pagination for large operations.
